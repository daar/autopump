Autopump is a small project to create an Arduino powered automatic air compressor controller. The controller has an LCD screen and two button interface. Two automatic valves and a pressure transmitter make it possible to achieve accurate control on the target pressure. The original purpose to build such a controller was to make it possible to automatically pump soccer balls, although the controller of course can be used for any purpose.

Below is a rendering of the Arduino UNO shield that is needed to control autopump. The shield connects all peripherals to the Arduino board.
