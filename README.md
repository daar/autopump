Autopump is a small project that utilizes an Arduino to automaticaly control an air compressor. The controller has an LCD screen and two button interface. Two automatic valves and a pressure transmitter make it possible to control the target pressure very precisely. The purpose for this controller is to automatically pump soccer balls, however any balls will do as will anything that needs to be inflated to a certain predefined pressure. Use your imagination.

I will be posting the code including a diagram and some pictures here. All sourcecode is released under GPL2 license and the hardware is released under the OSHW.
