Autopump is a small project that uses an Arduino to control a automatic compressed air pump. The controller has an LCD screen and two button interface. To automatic valves and a pressure transmitter make it possible to control the target pressure very precisely.

I will be posting the code including a diagram and some pictures here. All sourcecode is released under GPL2 license and the hardware is released under the OSHW.
