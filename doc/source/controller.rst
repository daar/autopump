Controller
==========

The most important part of the project is the controller. For pragmatic reasons a simple to program controller was needed that is cheap and widely availabe as well. It soon appeared that an `Arduino UNO`_ is very suitable for the task.

The Arduino Uno is an 8-bit microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs) and 6 analog inputs. It basically contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. The Arduino is programmed via the Arduino IDE in C. 

Getting started in programming the Arduino is very straightforward and intuitive. Basically the Arduino project consists of two void functions called *setup* and *loop* conveniently.

The nice thing about the Arduino is that is has a big community and a loarge number of libraries and hardware supported. You can litterally find anything if you put some time and effort into it.
