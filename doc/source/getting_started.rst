Getting started
===============
The initial reason to start such a project was to create an automatic ball pump. This project was born out of frustration and lack of a commercial alternative. The first step that needed to be taken was to make a design. Based on this design all hardware will be purchased and then the software will be written. Below is the P&ID (piping and instrumentation diagram) that was made for this project.

The diagram shows that two air valves (V1 & V2) will control if the object is inflated or deflated. A pressure sensor (PT) will measure the actual pressure and depending on the measured value either of the valves is opened until the desired pressure is reached.
