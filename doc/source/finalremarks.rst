Final remarks
=============

Creating autopump was most of all a fun excersise. I really hope other people will follow and create their own autopump. It's easy, fun and not too expensive to make one. If you create one of your own, I would really appreciate if you could send me a line via `email`_ including a picture of the result so I can post it up here.

Cost
----
The cost of the autopump is kept as low as possible so it will be feasible for others to create one by themselves. Of course there is a basic amount of hardware you need, including the Arduino, but as explained there are a number of resources where you can get it relatively cheap from even without posting costs in some cases! I will try to make a comprehensive list of all parts used below. I case I forgot something you can `email`_ me and I will correct it here.
